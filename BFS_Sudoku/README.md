To run the file just open it. If that for some reason doesn't work you can use the function sudoku_solver() to run the file.

Enter in 6 or 9 based on the size of the sudoku board that you want to enter. Then enter in each row one by one.
Separate each number with a space. Use the number 0 for blank spaces.
