#Instructions
To run my code for part 3, you will need to open up the file in a shell.

I created various sample mazes ranging from sizes 1x1 through 5x5, 10x10, and 20x20. The names of these mazes are fairly simple.
maze_one is the 1x1 maze, maze_two is the 2x2 maze, maze_three is the 3x3 maze and so on and so forth.

To run the tree search algorithm, enter in: tree_search(maze_size) 

To run the graph search algorithm, enter in: graph_search(maze_size)

The size that you choose to enter must be the word of the number and not the number itself. So instead of 2 you would enter in two.

#Bugs
1. The only bug that I have noticed is that the 10x10 maze and 20x20 mazes take way too long to finish if they even finish at all.
