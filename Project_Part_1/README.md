#Towers of Hanoi solver -- Bidirectional breadth first search versus breadth first search

#Instructions 
Simply run the program. it will print and return the time it took to find a solution, the total number of explored states that it took to get to the solution, and the solution itself (although the solution is returned as a node so it doesn't really give any valuable information. It will go all the way up to 9 rings for both searches. the 9-ring puzzle takes about a minute for the BFS and about 40 seconds for the BBFS.

#Bugs 
Have not ran into any bugs since I improved my code.
