#note: still trying to figure out how to implement the algorithms. Have been very busy lately
##instructions

1. simply run the file to start it. Or you can use the command csp_solver to initiate the program.
2. you will be asked for the size of the puzzle. 3 for 3x3, 4 for 4x4 etc.
3. you will then be asked to enter the type of puzzle. Enter in 'CrossMath' or 'Futoshiki'. If you pick Futoshiki you will be asked to fill in the rows of the puzzle. Separate each number with a space then hit enter to move on to the next row.
4. then you will be asked to enter in the constaints of the puzzle. for example A1 > A2 for Futoshiki or A1 + A2 + A3 = 5 for CrossMath
5. The program will do the rest (once finished).

##bugs
*the program won't work if you enter in the wrong amount of elements in a row.
*you must also enter in valid integers ranging from 1 to the puzzle size.
